## Setup
Usage depends on the setup of you development flow.
DockWatch is not recommended to be used in a production environment,
since it lets users with access to the Web and API interact directly
with the Docker containers for each node.

**As of now, there is no access control for either the components!**

### Example setup
The following steps are personal tips/preferences for
creating a pipeline from committing code, to the deploy. 

#### Prerequisites
* SCM (eg. Git w/`Github`)
* CI-tool (eg. `Concourse`)
* CD-tool (eg. `Rundeck`)
* Proxy (eg. `Traefik`)
* DockWatch

#### Flow
##### SCM
(_Source Control Management_)

Make commits to the SCM, independent of branch,
trigger the CI-tool through use of git-hooks.

##### CI
(_Continuous Integration_)

Let the CI-tool Build/compile,
or what ever the application/system requires,
before it wraps the application up in a Docker image.

For best result, let the docker image tags be on the following syntax:
`${DCKR_REG}/${APP_NAME}:${BRANCH_NAME}`.

Based on the following details (personal preference): 
* Application name: `Awesome App`
* Registry url: `registry.example.com`
* Issue tracker reference: `AA-123`
* Branch name: `feature/AA-123`

It's possible to create a setup like this:
```bash
DCKR_REG="registry.example.com"                     # Could be stored in the CI-tool
APP_NAME="awesome-app"                              # Defined by the pipeline
GIT_BRANCH="feature/aa-123_implement-stuff"         # Should be fetched from either SCM or CI-tool
VERSION=$(echo ${GIT_BRANCH##origin/} | tr "/_" -)  # Replace / and _ with -, also remove "origin/"
                                                    # from the branch name (optional)
docker build -t ${DCKR_REG}/${APP_NAME}:${VERSION} ${PWD}

# Resulting in:
# registry.example.com/awesome-app:feature-aa-123-implement-stuff
```

Add desired labels when building the Docker image.
(All labels will be available through the API)

Example labels:
* `branch=${GIT_BRANCH}`
* `app_name=${APP_NAME}`
* `version=${VERSION}`

_**TIP:** There could be a parameterized hook to
auto trigger deployment to development environments_

##### CD
(_Continuous Deployment_)

After building the Docker image, push it to the registry,
and the CI-tool should take over.

`Rundeck` makes it possible to access one or more nodes,
where it can be executed commands.
Parameters should be:
* `Application`
* `Version`
* `Environment` # Used to decide what nodes to access
* `Registry` # If you have multiple Docker Registries

Example:
```bash
IMG_REF="${REGISTRY}/${APPLICATION}:${VERSION}"

docker run -d \
  --name "${APPLICATION}-${VERSION}" \
  ${IMG_REF}
``` 

In this case, the `"${APPLICATION}-${VERSION}"` is representing the sub-domain,
dependent on the Traefik configuration.
So make sure `"${APPLICATION}-${VERSION}"` is "URL-friendly".

When deploying, remember to include all necessary environment labels.
Each label you add, will be available through the DockWatch API,
and will let you modify the frontend based upon the labels.

Example labels:
* `environment=dev` # _Should be changed to actual environment_
* `url=app1.dev.example.com` # _Dependent on Traefik setup,
container name (`app1` in this case) could represent the sub domain_

##### Proxy
With `Tr√¶fIk`/traefik, you'll be able to auto detect
your Docker containers, and create routes to each container.

So optimal, the earlier example will result in the following accessible URL:
`https://awesome-app-feature-aa-123-implement-stuff.dev.example.com`

##### DockWatch
DockWatch API will be running on each of the nodes,
with a DockWatch Web container at it's side.

The DockWatch Web is exposed through Traefik 
(`--label "traefik.frontend.rule='Host: dw.dev.example.com'"`)
to easily access the DockWatch panel.
